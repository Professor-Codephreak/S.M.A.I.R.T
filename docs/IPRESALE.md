Events

    Deposit(address indexed creator, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp): Emitted when the presale contract owner deposits tokens for sale.
    Purchase(address indexed beneficiary, uint256 contribution): Emitted for each purchase made during the presale.
    Finalized(address indexed creator, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp): Emitted when the presale is successfully finalized.
    Refund(address indexed beneficiary, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp): Emitted when a participant successfully claims a refund.
    TokenClaim(address indexed beneficiary, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp): Emitted when participants claim their purchased tokens after the presale is finalized.
    Cancel(address indexed creator, uint256 timestamp): Emitted when the presale is cancelled by the contract owner.

Functions

    deposit() external returns (uint256): Allows for the deposit of presale tokens by the owner.
    finalize() external returns (bool): Finalizes the presale, allowing for the distribution of tokens to participants and the withdrawal of funds raised to the beneficiary.
    cancel() external returns (bool): Cancels the presale and enables the refund process for participants.
    claim() external returns (uint256): Allows participants to claim their purchased tokens after the presale is finalized.
    refund() external returns (uint256): Enables participants to request a refund of their contribution if the presale is cancelled or if they are otherwise eligible for a refund according to the presale's terms.

Security Considerations

    Access Control:
        Ensure only authorized addresses can call functions like deposit, finalize, and cancel.
        Use modifiers to restrict access based on roles and permissions.

    State Validation:
        Validate the contract state before performing actions. For example, ensure the presale is in the correct state before finalizing or canceling.

    Contribution Limits:
        Enforce contribution limits (max and min) to prevent abuse.
        Validate that contributions do not exceed the hard cap and fall within the allowed range.

    Refund Logic:
        Ensure the refund process is secure and only allowed under valid conditions.
        Use the NotRefundable error to handle invalid refund attempts.

    Token Handling:
        Safely handle token transfers to prevent loss of funds.
        Use safe transfer methods from libraries like OpenZeppelin.

    Liquidity Provision:
        Carefully manage the liquidity provisioning process to prevent LiquificationFailed errors.

    Timestamp Validation:
        Ensure timestamps for the presale period are correctly validated to prevent off-schedule actions.

By implementing security best practices, the contract minimizes vulnerabilities to ensure a smooth and secure presale process.
